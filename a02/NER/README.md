## Results

| Model                       | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
| --------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Batch Gradient Descent      | 93.95%   | 76.68%    | 86.82% |
| Stochastic Gradient Descent | 95.88%   | 93.20%    | 78.79% |
| Mini-Batch Gradient Descent | 95.88%   | 93.20%    | 78.79% |

> Although Mini-Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent have the same results, Mini-Batch is faster than Stochastic Gradient Descent and they have different weights.
